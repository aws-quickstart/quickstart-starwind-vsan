== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

. Establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to both StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances and to the witness EC2 instance.
. Open the StarWind Management Console on all three EC2 instances. Connect the instances using their management Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses) or Domain Name System (DNS) names. 
. Verify that the witness instance is synchronized and that its mode is set to *Witness*. 
. Verify that both storage instances (nodes 1 and 2) have a health status of `Storage is working properly`. 
. On both storage instances, navigate to Disk Management. (In Windows, run `compmgmt.msc` and choose *Disk Management*.) Verify that the replicated StarWind VSAN volume is present. It should be an additional volume named CSV.

=== (Optional) Create and configure a Windows Server Failover Cluster

After you deploy this Quick Start, the {partner-product-short-name}â€“specific configuration is complete. Since StarWind HA storage devices are accessed using iSCSI by both StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances (nodes 1 and 2), data may become corrupted unless you create a failover cluster to manage the access. To create and configure a Windows Server Failover Cluster, follow these steps:

. Create the failover cluster, setting the required name and static IP addresses for it. For details, refer to https://www.starwindsoftware.com/resource-library/starwind-virtual-san-for-hyper-v-2-node-hyperconverged-scenario-with-windows-server-2016/#14bdf4cea7ba8ca523dcfb621c1969fa624feec3[Creating a Failover Cluster in Windows Server^] in the StarWind VSAN technical guide.

. (Optional) Add IP addresses needed for the cluster and its resources as secondary private IP addresses on the management network interface of the StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances (nodes 1 and 2). 

. Add the StarWind HA devices to the cluster.
.. In *Failover Cluster Manager*, choose *Cluster*, *Storage*, *Disks*. 
.. In the *Actions* panel, choose *Add Disk*.
.. Choose *StarWind disks* from the list, and verify the selection.
.. If you are using the StarWind HA device as a Cluster Shared Volume, open the context (right-click) menu for the disk, and choose *Add to Cluster Shared Volumes*.
. Set up the failover cluster quorum by creating a Server Message Block (SMB) file share on the StarWind VSAN EC2 witness instance that will host the file-share witness for the failover cluster.
. Add a security group rule to allow SMB access to the witness node.
.. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2[Amazon EC2 console^], and choose *Security Groups*.
.. Select the security group associated with the EC2 witness instance, and add a new inbound rule.
.. Add a rule allowing port 445 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic from the security group associated with the storage instances.
. Configure the file-share witness.
.. Open the context (right-click) menu for the cluster node. Choose *More Actions*, *Configure Cluster Quorum Settings*, *Next*.
.. Choose the quorum witness, and choose *Next*.
.. Choose *All Nodes* (both StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances), and choose *Next*.
.. Choose *Configure a file share witness*, and choose *Next*.
.. In the *File Share Path* box, enter the share path, and choose *Next*.
.. Review the summary page. Then choose *Finish*.
