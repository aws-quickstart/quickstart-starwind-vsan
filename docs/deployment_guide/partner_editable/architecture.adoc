Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../deployment_guide/images/starwind_qs_architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Remote Desktop (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances (nodes 1 and 2) in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These storage instances provide the virtualized highly-available iSCSI storage device and keep synchronous copies of it on each instance.
** A StarWind VSAN EC2 witness instance in Availability Zone 2. This witness instance monitors the storage instances in order to ensure quorum incase of a storage node failure.
** Two iSCSI elastic network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces allow storage clients to access the VSAN storage.
** Three management/witness network interfaces in Availability Zones 1, 2, and 3, which allow administrators management access to the instances.
** Two synchronization network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces are used to replicate the storage on the StarWind VSAN storage nodes.

//TODO Dave, In the diagram, only two of the management/witness network interfaces have arrows. What about the third one ... is an arrow maybe implied between it and storage node 1?
// I think it's implied, and adding additional arrows would make the diagram messy.

//TODO Dave, In the bullet points above, please fill in the blanks.
